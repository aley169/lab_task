    <h1>Self Belief is an art</h1>

    <div id="lab">
        <p>
           Self-esteem is a fairly stable trait that doesn't change much in individuals—unless
		   they put in some dedicated effort to improve it. It can generally be defined as our beliefs in our own inherent value,
		   worth, and how deserving we are of love, happiness, success, and other good things in life.
		   By contrast, self-confidence does not take into consideration any beliefs about the worthiness or overall value; rather, it focuses on the ability to succeed and beliefs about one’s likelihood of succeeding.

           The two are certainly related, but it is easy to see where the line is drawn between them; 
           self-esteem is about the success you feel you deserve,
           while self-confidence is about the success you feel you are capable of achieving.
